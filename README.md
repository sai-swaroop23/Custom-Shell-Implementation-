Custom Shell in C++
Assignment 2 – Linux OS

This project is a simple Linux shell implemented in C++. It allows users to run commands, manage processes, and perform redirection and piping similar to a basic Unix shell.

Features

Run built-in and external commands

Foreground and background process handling

Input and output redirection

Command piping

Basic job control

How It Works

The shell reads user input, parses the command, executes it, and manages processes. It supports multiple commands, redirection symbols, pipes, and background execution using '&'.
